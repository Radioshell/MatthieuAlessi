**Radiant is a concept created mainly as an occupation and a personal exercise. With a focus on the identity and how to make a small-scale cafe a modern place, there was an interesting premise. The goal: to create the concept of a unique meal experience that remains approachable and practical.**

<div style="clear:both; max-width:75%" class="paragraph">User Experience design is about setting the stage and the conditions for positive, useful and in the better cases meaningful experiences and interactions. Those interactions are engaged through the user's senses, from that we can think about the connection between user experience and the culinary fields, beyond the food itself.</div>

<div style="clear:both; max-width:75%" class="paragraph">After defining a target audience with personas and through a series of research, I thought about what kind of cafe experience my defined target of mostly young adults would want. Good food and service are baseline requirements, but it needs to be affordable and practical. The experience should be unique, and have well defined purpose and identity. </div>

> Designing for the senses to allow experiences to emerge, an exercise of world-building.

<div style="clear:both; max-width:75%" class="paragraph">The overall direction was quickly turned towards futurism and science fiction, it is an interesting theme because of its aesthetics and implications. After research and building moodboards, I decided to go for a themed restaurant that would focus on offering a particular sensory experience and a futuristic atmosphere, I wanted to go for a gentler type of Blade Runner aesthetic.</div>

<div style="clear:both; max-width:75%" class="paragraph">Combining futurism and Japanese iconography, The logo takes the circular and inviting shape from the rising sun. The name also evokes a sense of hope for the next day. Exciting splashes of neon color, and lively illustrations, and unusual remind us of how our senses can light up through positive experiences.</div>

<div style="clear:both; max-width:75%" class="paragraph">I thought Radiant as an inviting and original place that remains practical, to keep things modern and ease the customer's interaction, I designed an interface used to order. A 3d model was made to have an idea in the layout and organization of the place. The terminals are placed on spots where customers may be likely to stand while finding their way around.</div>
